In the dynamic professional landscape of Kerala, a pressing challenge spans diverse demographics and industries. Students pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, recent graduates, women reentering the workforce, experienced professionals, freelancers, retired experts, and various institutions in the region share a common struggle â€” the absence of a unified platform connecting their skills and aspirations with valuable gig opportunities.

For students and recent graduates in Kerala, the gap between academic learning and real-world application impedes their ability to acquire practical experience and earn income while studying or launching their careers. Women reentering the workforce in Kerala, seeking part-time or flexible work, face obstacles in accessing opportunities that align with their skills and schedules.

Retired professionals, corporations, SMEs, government entities, local governments, academic and research institutions, open-source communities, non-profit organizations, and innovators in Kerala grapple with the absence of a centralized hub to efficiently outsource work, collaborate, and translate academic knowledge into real-world applications, adding urgency to the need for a localized solution.
